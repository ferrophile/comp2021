Project Title

UST Bus Timetable Planner

Project Description
You should give a short description of your planned project. Note it's a plan only. You don't need to implement every function as mentioned. But you should not switch to a totally irrelevant topic for your final product.

For me and other local students, the greatest challenge in life is to get to HKUST campus amidst the neverending queues at Choi Hung :)
I plan to make use of live Estimated Arrival Time (ETA) data, distributed regularly online by the bus company, to display them in a better and more organised way (e.g. estimate their current location) for HKUST students to view and plan their journey effectively.

Any challenges expected to meet?
For example, our project needs sound effect. I plan to use xxx to solve it. The reason to choose xxx is yyy.

Data needs to be updated actively so I plan to use shell script stored at the server-side to achieve this. In case it is not possible, data will be manually updated via HTML form + PHP which is less desirable but still works (to some extent).

Distribution of workload among team members?
Rough estimation of work distribution

I am working alone lol
